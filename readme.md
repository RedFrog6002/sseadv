### sse-adv gui for tk2d

![s](s.gif)

this was only tested on hollow knight. I don't know if it works on other tk2d games.

the plan was to get this working with regular unity sprites as well but I never added that when I made this.

#### features:

along with viewing sprites and animations, you can also export a whole spritesheet, animation, or single sprite to a folder/png. you can also import a whole spritesheet.
